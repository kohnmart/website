        <p>
          Hello, everyone. My name is Martin Kohnle, I am a 24-year-old student
          from Augsburg. I am currently studying

          with a focus on computer science in the 5th semester. IAM is an
          interdisciplinary course based at the Faculty of Design and Computer
          Science. This mixture allows me to cover a wide fundamental spectrum
          in design, interaction and computer science. I focus on full-stack web
          development and machine learning.
          <br />
          <br />
          Design, interaction and technology play a role in all of my projects.
          Even if my focus is now on coding and databases, I can evaluate and
          understand all project's components. The aim is to create a product,
          that is convincing for a specific target group and can solve a real
          problem.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition, I have spent a lot of time in photography over the past
          few years. It was mainly about working for the first time on long-term
          projects, leading a team and understanding, that success depends to a
          large extent on proper communication. All in all, the teamwork is
          exciting and varied. <br />
          A high level of creativity, innovation and skills comes together. It
          expands the horizon and perspective on a wide range of challenges. The
          collective know-how makes it possible to find solutions not
          compromise, to recognize issues early and to adapt the design to
          technical possibilities.

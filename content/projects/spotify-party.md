## Spotify Party
Python / Django Framework / Websocket / Spotify-API <br /> <br />

Introduction: <br />
At parties with many guests, the music that one would like to hear is often not played. Who knows who is actually putting on the music? With SpotifyParty, everyone can easily have a say via the app. The host shares any playlist and guests can join using a code. Tracks from the playlist are displayed live within the session. The song with the most likes will then play next. 
All those involved should also receive live feedback
the status of the voting as well as the playback progress
of the current song. <br />  <br />

The foreground of all design decisions should
the lowest possible entry hurdle for one
spontaneous use at parties.
After applying in all likelihood
after being mainly used on mobile devices
is an optimized user interface
desirable.

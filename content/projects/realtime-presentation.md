## Introduction 

Date: August 2019 - January 2021 <br />
Team: Martin Kohnle, BKPV employees, F端rth town hall staff, KIGG Media <br />
Role: Head of Development and Design <br /> <br />

#### Background
I am particularly proud of this project, it is an important milestone in my development. I would even call it a personal moonshot.
No project that I have done to date has involved such responsibility and risk. This project was an official assignment
that I received at the beginning of 2019. The occasion of the presentation was the 100th anniversary of the Bavarian Auditing Association.
Many important mayors and high-ranking politicians attended.
It took place a year later in the F端rth town hall.<br /> <br />

## Concept 
#### Creating the presentation

The idea was to develop an interactive presentation that can process large amounts of data in real time.
There is no way around a game engine to bring these two factors together.
To prove my technical skills, I developed a primitive prototype.
Which was able to show a possible process with various features such as an interactive
camera path, 2D and 3D objects, animations, presentation slides and a generated height map. <br /> <br />

#### Transfering information
Does this provide a better way of conveying information than with a classic presentation? It depends. 
In presentations of this kind, the focus is on experience and conviction. The software makes 
it possible for companies to present themselves in a completely new way. We open up the three-dimensional 
space, visualize products and history. Creating a long lasting feeling and perspective. At these events, 
nobody remembers the 35th presentation slide with the annual balance sheet.  <br /> <br />

#### Benefits of real time
Real time helps more than just visualize. Our presentations are shown in large halls on 16 meter 
screens with backlight projectors. Each hall is different in terms of space and lighting technology. 
It is not always possible to coordinate everything beforehand. The engine allows us to 
dynamically adjust light and color settings shortly before or even during the presentation.
In addition, the camera and media of the presentation can 
be controlled from the direction in case the presentator makes a mistake or want to step back.
An absolutely flexible presentation is reassuring for everyone involved.

## Showcase
#### Main Scence
Introduced by the intro, this scene became the center of the presentation. Many speakers, as well as the band, used this as a background. The auditing association is responsible for the federal state of Bavaria. Accordingly, our globe consists only of the Bavaria map. A little gag.
The logo flies endlessly around the earth in an orbit.

#### History Scence
Showing history and development of the association.

#### Present Scence
Transfer to the present. Showing the development and current activities.
Core of the entire presentation. Features such as slides, 2D and 3D objects, terrain maps, films and live speeches are shown here.

## Introduction

#### Background

I am particularly proud of this project, it is an important milestone in my development. I would even call it a personal moonshot.
No project that I have done to date has involved such responsibility and risk. This project was an official assignment
that I received at the beginning of 2019. The occasion of the presentation was the 100th anniversary of the Bavarian Auditing Association.
Many important mayors and high-ranking politicians attended.
It took place a year later in the Fürth town hall.

## Concept

#### Creating the presentation

The idea was to develop an interactive presentation that can process large amounts of data in real-time. There is no way around a game engine to bring these two factors together. To prove my technical skills, I developed a primitive prototype. Which was able to show a possible process with various features such as an interactive camera path, 2D and 3D objects, animations, presentation slides and a generated heightmap. The prototype was able to confirm the technical implementation. Of course, the entire concept and visual quality had to be scaled for the official presentation. The show should have a total length of 2 hours.
<br /> <br />

#### Transfering information

Does this provide a better way of conveying information than with a classic presentation? It depends. In presentations of this kind, the focus is on experience and conviction. The software makes it possible for companies to present themselves in a completely new way. We open up the three-dimensional
space, visualize products and history. Creating a long-lasting feeling and perspective. At these events, nobody remembers the 35th presentation slide with the annual balance sheet.

#### Benefits of real time

The concept is essentially made for large halls, 16 meters screens with backlight projectors. Each hall is different in terms of space and lighting technology.
It is not always possible to coordinate everything beforehand. The engine allows to dynamically adjust light and color settings shortly before or even during the presentation. Accordingly, changes to the content at short notice are also possible days before the deadline. An absolutely flexible presentation is reassuring for everyone involved.

## Showcase

#### Logo Scence

This scene was visible for most of the presentation. Many speakers, as well as the band, used this as a background. The auditing association is responsible for the federal state of Bavaria. Accordingly, our globe consists only of the Bavaria map. Sure, that was a funny gag. But it also had a technical background. This representation is intended to draw attention to the digital transformation, that is taking place in Bavaria.

#### History Scence

Images and documents of the history were visualized in an animated book.

#### Hall Scence

Core of the presentation. Showing the development and current activities.
Features such as slides, 2D and 3D objects, terrain maps, videos and live speeches were displayed here.

## Review

This presentation should be seen as a study. The aim was to find out whether the use of 3D space and real-time could result in an advantage. First, it was definitely a success. The employees of the association were emotionally touched by the new representation of their workplace. They had never seen each other in this perspective before. We achieved the desired effect, which was great! I am certain that we have only implemented a minimum of what would be possible. After all, I was just in the first semester.

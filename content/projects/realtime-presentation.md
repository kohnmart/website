## Introduction

#### Background

I am particularly proud of this project, it is an important milestone in my development. I would even call it a personal moonshot.
No project that I have done to date has involved such responsibility and risk. This project was an official assignment
that I received at the beginning of 2019. The occasion of the presentation was the 100th anniversary of the Bavarian Auditing Association.
Many important mayors and high-ranking politicians attended.
It took place a year later in the Fürth town hall.<br /> <br />

## Concept

#### Creating the presentation

The idea was to develop an interactive presentation that can process large amounts of data in real time.
There is no way around a game engine to bring these two factors together.
To prove my technical skills, I developed a primitive prototype.
Which was able to show a possible process with various features such as an interactive
camera path, 2D and 3D objects, animations, presentation slides and a generated height map. <br /> <br />

#### Transfering information

Does this provide a better way of conveying information than with a classic presentation? It depends.
In presentations of this kind, the focus is on experience and conviction. The software makes
it possible for companies to present themselves in a completely new way. We open up the three-dimensional
space, visualize products and history. Creating a long lasting feeling and perspective. At these events,
nobody remembers the 35th presentation slide with the annual balance sheet. <br /> <br />

#### Benefits of real time

Real time helps more than just visualize. Our presentations are shown in large halls on 16 meter
screens with backlight projectors. Each hall is different in terms of space and lighting technology.
It is not always possible to coordinate everything beforehand. The engine allows us to
dynamically adjust light and color settings shortly before or even during the presentation.
In addition, the camera and media of the presentation can
be controlled from the direction in case the presentator makes a mistake or want to step back.
An absolutely flexible presentation is reassuring for everyone involved.

## Showcase

#### Main Scence

Introduced by the intro, this scene became the center of the presentation. Many speakers, as well as the band, used this as a background. The auditing association is responsible for the federal state of Bavaria. Accordingly, our globe consists only of the Bavaria map. A little gag.
The logo flies endlessly around the earth in an orbit.

#### History Scence

Images and documents of the history were visualized in an animated book.

#### Present Scence

Core of the entire presentation. Showing the development and current activities.
Features such as slides, 2D and 3D objects, terrain maps, films and live speeches are shown here.

## Review

This presentation should be seen as a study. The aim was to find out whether the use of 3D space and real time could result in an advantage. First of all it was definitely a success, the employees of the association were emotionally touched by the new representation of their workplace. They had never seen each other in this perspective before. We achieved the desired effect, that was really great!

This kind of presentation creates completely new possibilities and perspectives, I think we have only implemented a minimum of what would be possible. That was just the beginning of a study to determine whether there was any need for it.

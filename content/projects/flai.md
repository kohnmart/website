## Introduction

#### Background

I am particularly proud of this project, it is an important milestone in my development. I would even call it a personal moonshot.
No project that I have done to date has involved such responsibility and risk. This project was an official assignment
that I received at the beginning of 2019. The occasion of the presentation was the 100th anniversary of the Bavarian Auditing Association.
Many important mayors and high-ranking politicians attended.
It took place a year later in the FÃ¼rth town hall.

## In Progress

We are developing a web application in which users can learn the basics of German Sign Language. <br />
A key feature is camera interaction. The gestures are evaluated by the neural network and returned as visual feedback. 
We will set up a recurrent network since some of the letters are made up of movements. In the next step, we will create the data set with professional sign language teachers.

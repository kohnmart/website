## Review <br />

All team members were able to meet the requirements for the app.
In the current state, all the necessary features have been implemented so that the app can function as a prototype.
The technical implementation of a Python web application was primarily required in this project. The integration of a web socket and the Spotify API was a personal requirement. The design should be considered secondary.
<br /> <br />

#### Perspective <br />

The base of the app is a good starting point for future extensions.
For example, it should be possible to configure the hard-coded preferences such as the number of tracks,
the voting time and playlists by third parties. A simple application and low entry barriers apply to all future extensions.

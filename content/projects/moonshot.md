## 100th Year Anniversary

### Unity / Realtime Rendered Presentation / Moonshot <br /> <br />

#### Roles and Rescources

Role - Head of Development and Design <br />
Client - BKPV <br />
Development - 6 Months <br />
Contributors - 20 <br /> <br />

#### Background

I am particularly proud of this project, it is an important milestone in my development. I would even call it a personal moonshot.
No project that I have done to date has involved such responsibility and risk. This project was an official assignment
that I received at the beginning of 2019. So, much of the work was done before my actual study.
The presentation took place a year later in the FÃ¼rth town hall.<br /> <br />

### Inspire <br /> <br />

#### Creating the presentation

The idea was to develop an interactive presentation that can process large amounts of data in real time.
There is no way around a game engine to bring these two factors together.
To prove my technical skills, I developed a primitive prototype.
Which was able to show a possible process with various features such as an interactive
camera path, 2D and 3D objects, animations, presentation slides and a generated height map. <br /> <br />

#### Transfering information
Does this provide a better way of conveying information than with a classic presentation? It depends. 
In presentations of this kind, the focus is on experience and conviction. The software makes 
it possible for companies to present themselves in a completely new way. We open up the three-dimensional 
space, visualize products and history. Creating a long lasting feeling and perspective. At these events, 
nobody remembers the 35th presentation slide with the annual balance sheet.  <br /> <br />

#### Benefits of real time
Real time helps more than just visualize. Our presentations are shown in large halls on 16 meter 
screens with backlight projectors. Each hall is different in terms of space and lighting technology. 
It is not always possible to coordinate everything beforehand. The engine allows us to 
dynamically adjust light and color settings shortly before or even during the presentation.
In addition, the camera and media of the presentation can 
be controlled from the direction in case the presentator makes a mistake.
An absolutely flexible presentation is reassuring for everyone involved.

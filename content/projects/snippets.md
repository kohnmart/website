## Snippets

### VsCode / Javascript / Vue 3 / Prism.js <br /> <br />

Snippets is a small social media web-application for developers. The basis consists of the classic methods of creating, 
liking and commenting on posts. The special feature of the app is the type of post. The users share special, 
interesting and complex code snippets which are also highlighted in the corresponding language.
Code support is usually offered on these platforms. Our intention was to create a platform that shows the code and its logic as a work of art. <br /> <br />

#### Design

A technically flawless web-application was required in this study project. 
Accordingly, the general design has been kept simple. A special design effort
was invested in the code highlighting with Prism.js.<br /> <br />



### Brief Summary <br /> <br />

#### Get started <br />
Registration is required for posting and interacting. The authentication pages can be accessed 
from the start page via "Login". An input validation was developed for the entire app with corresponding error messages. <br />

#### Create a Post!  <br />
The Post Form consists of the areas language, title, code and category. The category can be thought of as a tag 
to search for specific posts. Similar to login/registration, validation is also used here. 
Mandatory fields are language, title and code. The post can be removed at any time.  <br />

 #### Outlook <br />
The base of the app is a good starting point for future extensions. 
For example, it should be possible to configure the hard-coded preferences such as the number of tracks, 
the voting time and playlists by third parties. A simple application and low entry barriers apply to all future extensions.

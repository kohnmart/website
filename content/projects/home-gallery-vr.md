## Introduction

Home Gallery VR is a virtual reality application for photographers and artists. The creators can view their images in unprecedented size and perspective. Nowadays, we are consuming images extremely quickly on social media and other creator platforms. So fast, that we often don't understand how much passion, creativity and energy someone has put into a project. With this application, I want to return the focus and value to the individual artwork. <br /> <br />

## File Browser
I developed an embedded file browser that can transfer images from any folder to the frames.

## Getting Started

The best way to get to know the essential features is to follow the introductory tutorial.
You can watch that at any time via the settings. <br /> <br />

#### Set-Manager

In the gallery, there are 20 ready-made frames to place pictures. You can create your own framesets for several themes or categories. These can be easily created, loaded and deleted. Click on any frame to open the file browser and open the Set-Manager. You should first create a new set to save your pictures in! <br /> <br />

#### Image-Manager

You are ready to populate your gallery! To do this, simply click on any frame to open the file browser. Select an image, adjust the size and click save.

#### View 360

As a special feature, there is a walk-in globe to view 360-degree images.
To do this, simply click on the globe and select an image.
I took this example image with my cell phone camera.<br /> <br />

## Review <br />

As a private project, Home Gallery VR is the only application that I am continuously developing.
When I started back then, I didn't have any programming skills at all. Especially not in the development of an embedded browser. I have acquired a lot of knowledge and experience through my studies and that helps me to advance this project. Of course, this app still has weaknesses in terms of design and interface. First of all, it was important for me to develop and test the technical features. In the future, I will focus more on design and user experience. 
<br /> <br />

#### Perspective <br />
The app is now in a stable state that allows design improvements and technical extensions. The lighting and optics of the scenery should be adjustable to create harmony with the individual gallery. The user interface should be revised. The 360 Globe should also be able to play video formats. In addition, I would like to make the app available to testers to check various use cases for errors and bugs. <br /> <br />

The future of Home Gallery VR will be great!
